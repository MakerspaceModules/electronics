# Instructor Notes

A presentation to accompany these labs is available on [Prezi](http://prezi.com/uq4dierasygg/electronics-101-for-workshop-88/?kw=view-uq4dierasygg&rc=ref-407810).  The class is designed with the assumption that attendees have no prior knowledge whatsoever of electronics. 

This class typically takes 2 hours.

## Suggested class flow

### Before students arrive

* Print out the lab handouts (Resistor color code sheet).
* Make sure multimeters have batteries in them
* Pull out two drawers of resistors (330-ohm and 1k or 10k are good values to use). 
 
### During class
* The intro presentation should take roughly 15-20 minutes. Discussions of analogies to hydrodynamics and other systems are encouraged if attendees bring them up.
* Pass out the resistors and resistor code sheets when it comes up in the presentation.  Have everyone figure out the values based on the colors. Then have them measure resistance with the multimeter. Discuss how resistance measurements can only be done with the resistors OUT of the circuit.
* After the presentation, allow attendees 5-10 minutes to work with the simulation to become familiar with how it works. 
* Have everyone make a circuit in the simulation with one battery and one bulb. Discuss the increase of current as battery voltage increases. 
* Discuss the difference between measuring the voltage across elements and measuring the current through elements.
* Have everyone set up an ammeter (NOT the non-contact ammeter) in the simulation.
* Measure the current in the simulation for 2 V, then double the voltage.  Then double again and show that current and voltage are proportional. Write Ohm's law on the board.
* Have everyone do examples where something is unknown - V, I, or R.
* Have everyone construct a simple circuit of battery, resistor, and LED on the breadboard. Everyone should measure the voltage across the resistor then calculate the expected current.
* Everyone should set up the circuit to measure the current and get the setup checked before connecting the battery. 
* Show how to calculate power dissipated in the circuit.
* Show an oscilloscope and talk about what it is.
* Review all concepts that were covered in the class, ask what questions participants have, then thank them for coming.
